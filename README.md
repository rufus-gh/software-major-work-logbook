### Use of Error Control and Appropriate User Messages
Robust error handling has been implemented throughout all components of the application. The backend uses try-catch blocks with generic error responses to prevent sensitive information exposure, while the frontend provides user-friendly error messages through toast notifications and alert dialogs. Integration testing revealed critical error scenarios, such as medication synchronization issues, which were resolved through comprehensive error handling that prevents application crashes and provides meaningful feedback to users.

**Backend Error Handling Example:**
```javascript
// Generic error handler middleware - catches all unhandled errors
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // Log the full error details for developers to debug
  console.error('Server error:', err);
  
  // Check if we're in development mode to determine error detail level
  const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
  
  // Send appropriate response based on environment
  res.status(err.status || 500).json({
    success: false,
    // Show detailed error in development, generic message in production
    message: isDevelopment ? err.message : 'An error occurred processing your request',
    // Include stack trace only in development for security
    ...(isDevelopment && { stack: err.stack })
  });
});

// API endpoint with comprehensive error handling
app.get('/patients/:id/pills', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Extract patient ID from URL parameters
    const { id } = req.params;
    
    // Query database for specific patient using Prisma ORM
    const patient = await prisma.patient.findUnique({
      where: { id: parseInt(id) } // Convert string ID to integer
    });
    
    // Check if patient exists in database
    if (!patient) {
      // Return 404 status with user-friendly error message
      return res.status(404).json({
        success: false,
        message: 'Patient not found'
      });
    }
    
    // Return patient's medication list (empty array if no pills)
    res.json(patient.pills || []);
  } catch (error) {
    // Log detailed error for developers
    console.error('Error fetching patient pills:', error);
    
    // Return generic error message to prevent information leakage
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Unable to fetch medication data'
    });
  }
});
```

**Mobile App Error Handling:**
```javascript
// Firebase authentication with specific error messages
const handleLogin = async () => {
  try {
    // Attempt to sign in user with Firebase authentication
    await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
    
    // Navigate to home screen on successful login
    navigation.navigate('Home');
  } catch (error) {
    // Default error message if specific error not recognized
    let errorMessage = 'Login failed';
    
    // Handle specific Firebase authentication error codes
    switch (error.code) {
      case 'auth/invalid-email':
        errorMessage = 'Invalid email address';
        break;
      case 'auth/user-not-found':
        errorMessage = 'User not found';
        break;
      case 'auth/wrong-password':
        errorMessage = 'Incorrect password';
        break;
      case 'auth/too-many-requests':
        errorMessage = 'Too many attempts. Please try again later';
        break;
      default:
        // Log unexpected errors for debugging
        console.error('Login error:', error);
    }
    
    // Show user-friendly error message in alert dialog
    Alert.alert('Error', errorMessage);
  }
};
```

### Coding Commentary and Comprehensive Examples
The application demonstrates sophisticated coding practices through well-documented and maintainable code:

**Real-time Notification Scheduling with Time-based Medication Reminders:**
```javascript
const checkPendingMedications = async () => {
  try {
    // Get current date and time for comparison
    const now = new Date();
    
    // Create a new date object for today's morning time
    const todayMorningTime = new Date();
    // Set the morning time using hours and minutes from settings
    todayMorningTime.setHours(morningTime.getHours(), morningTime.getMinutes(), 0, 0);
    
    // Create 1-hour window for morning medications
    // Window starts exactly at scheduled time
    const morningWindowStart = new Date(todayMorningTime.getTime());
    // Window ends 1 hour after scheduled time
    const morningWindowEnd = new Date(todayMorningTime.getTime());
    morningWindowEnd.setHours(morningWindowEnd.getHours() + 1);
    
    // Check if current time falls within the morning medication window
    // and if morning medications haven't been taken today
    if (now >= morningWindowStart && now <= morningWindowEnd && !takenToday.morning) {
      // Show medication banner with morning medications
      setMedicationBanner({ timeOfDay: 'morning', medications: morningMeds });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Log any errors that occur during medication checking
    console.error('Error checking pending medications:', error);
  }
};
```

**QR Code Scanning for Secure Doctor-Patient Account Linking:**
```javascript
const handleConnectToDoctor = async () => {
  // Validate that doctor code is not empty or just whitespace
  if (!doctorCode.trim()) {
    // Show error alert if code is missing
    Alert.alert('Error', 'Please enter a valid doctor code');
    return; // Exit function early if validation fails
  }
  
  try {
    // Make HTTP POST request to backend API for patient connection
    const response = await fetch(`http://${ip}:3000/connect-patient`, {
      method: 'POST', // Use POST method for data submission
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, // Specify JSON content
      body: JSON.stringify({
        // Send current user's email from Firebase auth
        patientEmail: auth.currentUser?.email,
        // Send trimmed doctor code to remove whitespace
        doctorCode: doctorCode.trim()
      })
    });
    
    // Check if HTTP response indicates success (status 200-299)
    if (response.ok) {
      // Show success message to user
      Alert.alert('Success', 'Successfully connected to doctor!');
    } else {
      // Show generic error message for failed connection
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to connect. Please check the doctor code.');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Log detailed error information for debugging
    console.error('Connection error:', error);
    // Show network error message to user (more specific than generic error)
    Alert.alert('Error', 'Network error. Please try again.');
  }
};
```

**Fortnightly Medication Scheduling with Advanced Date Calculations:**
```javascript
// Helper function to calculate which week of the 14-day cycle we're in
const getFortnightWeek = (date) => {
  // Use fixed reference date to ensure consistent calculations
  const referenceDate = new Date('2024-01-01');
  
  // Calculate time difference between given date and reference
  const timeDiff = date.getTime() - referenceDate.getTime();
  
  // Convert milliseconds to days (1000ms * 3600s * 24h = 1 day)
  const daysSinceReference = Math.floor(timeDiff / (1000 * 3600 * 24));
  
  // Get position within 14-day cycle (0-13)
  const cycleDay = daysSinceReference % 14;
  
  // Return 0 for first week (days 0-6) or 1 for second week (days 7-13)
  return cycleDay < 7 ? 0 : 1;
};

// Get medications scheduled for specific time and day
const getScheduledMeds = (medications, timeOfDay) => {
  // Get current date for calculations
  const today = new Date();
  
  // Determine which week of the fortnight cycle we're in
  const fortnightWeek = getFortnightWeek(today);
  
  // Get day of week (Monday=0, Sunday=6)
  const dayInWeek = getDayInWeek(today);
  
  // Calculate index into 14-day schedule array
  // Week 0: indices 0-6, Week 1: indices 7-13
  const scheduleIndex = (fortnightWeek * 7) + dayInWeek;
  
  // Filter medications to find those scheduled for this time
  return medications.filter(med => {
    // Check if medication has custom 14-day schedule array
    if (med.schedule && Array.isArray(med.schedule) && med.schedule.length === 14) {
      // Get the schedule for today from the 14-day array
      const daySchedule = med.schedule[scheduleIndex];
      // Return true if medication is scheduled for this time of day
      return daySchedule && daySchedule[timeOfDay];
    }
    
    // Fallback to simple daily dosage system for medications without custom schedule
    const dosageKey = timeOfDay === 'morning' ? 'morningDosage' : 'eveningDosage';
    // Return true if dosage is set and greater than 0
    return med[dosageKey] && parseInt(med[dosageKey]) > 0;
  });
};
```

**Cross-platform Data Synchronization and Error Handling:**
```javascript
const fetchUserData = async () => {
  try {
    // Get current user's email from Firebase authentication
    const userEmail = auth.currentUser?.email;
    
    // Exit early if no user is logged in
    if (!userEmail) return;

    // Fetch user ID and account type from backend API
    const idResponse = await fetch(`http://${ip}:3000/idFromEmail/${userEmail}`);
    const idData = await idResponse.json();
    
    // Only proceed if user is registered as a patient
    if (idData.type === 'patient') {
      // Fetch patient data and medications in parallel for better performance
      const [patientResponse, medsResponse] = await Promise.all([
        fetch(`http://${ip}:3000/patients/${idData.id}`), // Get patient profile
        fetch(`http://${ip}:3000/patients/${idData.id}/pills`) // Get medication list
      ]);
      
      // Parse JSON responses from both API calls
      const patientData = await patientResponse.json();
      const medsData = await medsResponse.json();
      
      // Update React state with synchronized data from server
      // Use fallback values to handle missing data gracefully
      setUserName(patientData.name || patientData.firstName);
      setMedications(medsData || []); // Default to empty array if no medications
      
      // Refresh push notifications if medication data has changed
      await refreshNotificationsIfNeeded(medsData);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Log error details for debugging but don't crash the app
    console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
    // Graceful degradation - app continues to function with cached/existing data
    // User won't see error message as this is background sync
  }
};
```

**Advanced State Management for Medication Tracking:**
```javascript
const markMedicationsAsTaken = async (timeOfDay, medications, showToast = true) => {
  try {
    // Create detailed record of medication intake for tracking
    const record = {
      date: new Date().toISOString(), // ISO format for consistent storage
      timeOfDay: timeOfDay, // 'morning' or 'evening'
      // Map medication objects to simpler format for storage
      medications: medications.map(med => ({
        id: med.id || med.name, // Use ID if available, fallback to name
        name: med.name
      })),
      takenAt: new Date().toISOString(), // Timestamp when marked as taken
      late: false // Could be calculated based on scheduled time vs taken time
    };

    // Retrieve existing medication records from local storage
    const existingRecords = await AsyncStorage.getItem('medicationTakenRecords');
    // Parse existing records or initialize empty array
    const records = existingRecords ? JSON.parse(existingRecords) : [];
    
    // Add new record to existing records
    records.push(record);
    
    // Save updated records back to local storage
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('medicationTakenRecords', JSON.stringify(records));
    
    // Update UI state to reflect changes immediately
    await loadTakenMedications(); // Refresh taken medication status
    setMedicationBanner(null); // Hide medication reminder banner
    
    // Show success feedback to user (optional, controlled by parameter)
    if (showToast) {
      showTakenSuccess(timeOfDay);
    }
    
    // Check for any remaining pending medications after short delay
    // Delay allows UI updates to complete before checking
    setTimeout(() => checkPendingMedications(), 500);
  } catch (error) {
    // Log error but don't show to user as this is internal state management
    console.error('Error marking medications as taken:', error);
  }
};
```

### Program Functionality
The ReMedi application provides comprehensive functionality including user authentication, medication management, notification scheduling, doctor-patient connectivity, and real-time data synchronization. The program successfully addresses all core requirements for medication adherence tracking while maintaining scalability and reliability across multiple platforms.

**User Authentication System:**
```javascript
// Firebase configuration and initialization
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';

// Firebase configuration object with environment variables for security
const firebaseConfig = {
  // API key for Firebase authentication service
  apiKey: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  // Authentication domain for Firebase project
  authDomain: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  // Unique project identifier for Firebase
  projectId: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  // ... other Firebase configuration options
};

// Initialize Firebase app with configuration
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

// Export authentication instance for use throughout the app
export const auth = getAuth(app);
```

**Medication Management API:**
```javascript
// API endpoint to add medication to a specific patient
app.post('/patients/:id/pills', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Extract patient ID from URL parameters
    const { id } = req.params;
    
    // Extract medication details from request body
    const { name, morningDosage, eveningDosage, schedule } = req.body;
    
    // Find patient in database using Prisma ORM
    const patient = await prisma.patient.findUnique({
      where: { id: parseInt(id) } // Convert string ID to integer for database query
    });
    
    // Check if patient exists
    if (!patient) {
      // Return 404 error if patient not found
      return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Patient not found' });
    }
    
    // Get existing medications or initialize empty array
    const currentPills = patient.pills || [];
    
    // Create new medication object with unique ID and current timestamp
    const newMedication = {
      id: Date.now().toString(), // Use timestamp as unique ID
      name, // Medication name from request
      morningDosage: parseInt(morningDosage) || 0, // Convert to integer, default to 0
      eveningDosage: parseInt(eveningDosage) || 0, // Convert to integer, default to 0
      schedule: schedule || null, // Custom schedule array or null for simple dosing
      dateAdded: new Date().toISOString() // Timestamp when medication was added
    };
    
    // Add new medication to existing list
    const updatedPills = [...currentPills, newMedication];
    
    // Update patient record in database with new medication list
    await prisma.patient.update({
      where: { id: parseInt(id) },
      data: { pills: updatedPills } // Update pills field with new array
    });
    
    // Return success response with the newly added medication
    res.json({ success: true, medication: newMedication });
  } catch (error) {
    // Log error for debugging
    console.error('Error adding medication:', error);
    
    // Return generic error message to client
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to add medication' });
  }
});
```

### Simplicity and Effectiveness of Graphics
The user interface design prioritizes accessibility and clarity, with a carefully designed color scheme that uses light mode for the mobile app (enhancing accessibility for elderly users) and dark mode for the web dashboard. The logo combines medical symbolism (cross) with natural elements (leaf) to create a trustworthy and approachable brand identity.

### Effective Use of Animation and Audio
Strategic animations enhance user experience through smooth transitions, success notifications with fade-in effects, and interactive feedback for user actions. The notification system provides audio alerts for medication reminders, ensuring users are effectively notified even when the app is in the background.

**Animation Implementation:**
```javascript
// Success toast animation with fade-in and slide-up effects
const showTakenSuccess = (timeOfDay) => {
  // Create appropriate success message based on time of day
  const message = timeOfDay === 'morning' ? 
    'Morning medications taken! ✓' : 
    'Evening medications taken! ✓';
  
  // Update state with success message text
  setSuccessMessageText(message);
  // Show the success message component
  setShowTakenSuccessMessage(true);
  
  // Reset animation value to starting position (invisible)
  successFadeAnim.setValue(0);
  
  // Create complex animation sequence with multiple phases
  Animated.sequence([
    // Phase 1: Fade in with scale effect (400ms)
    Animated.timing(successFadeAnim, {
      toValue: 1, // Animate to fully visible
      duration: 400, // Animation duration in milliseconds
      useNativeDriver: true, // Use native driver for better performance
    }),
    // Phase 2: Stay visible for 2 seconds
    Animated.delay(2000), // Pause animation for 2 seconds
    // Phase 3: Fade out and slide up (400ms)
    Animated.timing(successFadeAnim, {
      toValue: 0, // Animate back to invisible
      duration: 400, // Same duration as fade in
      useNativeDriver: true,
    })
  ]).start(() => {
    // Callback function executed when animation completes
    // Hide the success message component from UI
    setShowTakenSuccessMessage(false);
  });
};

// Animated toast component with transform effects
<Animated.View 
  style={[
    styles.successToast, // Base styles for the toast
    {
      // Animate opacity from 0 (invisible) to 1 (fully visible)
      opacity: successFadeAnim,
      transform: [{
        // Animate vertical position - slide down from top
        translateY: successFadeAnim.interpolate({
          inputRange: [0, 1], // Animation value range
          outputRange: [-100, 0], // Start 100px above, end at original position
        })
      }, {
        // Animate scale - grow from 80% to 100% size
        scale: successFadeAnim.interpolate({
          inputRange: [0, 1], // Animation value range
          outputRange: [0.8, 1], // Start at 80% scale, end at 100%
        })
      }]
    }
  ]}
>
  {/* Display the success message text */}
  <Text style={styles.toastText}>{successMessageText}</Text>
</Animated.View>
```

**Notification Service with Audio:**
```javascript
// Configure notification behavior with sound for the entire app
Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldShowAlert: true, // Show notification alert when app is in foreground
    shouldPlaySound: true, // Enable audio alerts for notifications
    shouldSetBadge: true, // Update app icon badge with notification count
  }),
});

// Schedule notification with custom sound and interactive actions
const scheduleNotification = async (medicationTime, medications) => {
  // Schedule a local notification for specific date/time
  await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: {
      title: "💊 Time for your medication!", // Notification title with emoji
      // Dynamic body text showing number of medications
      body: `Take your ${medications.length} medication(s)`,
      sound: 'default', // Use system default notification sound
      // Additional data passed with notification for handling responses
      data: {
        timeOfDay: medicationTime, // 'morning' or 'evening'
        medications: medications // Array of medication objects
      },
    },
    trigger: {
      date: notificationTime, // When to trigger the notification
    },
  });
};
```

### User Friendliness (Ease of Use)
Extensive user testing across three age groups (16, 43, and 66 years old) directly informed user interface improvements. Key enhancements included enlarged interactive components for elderly users, streamlined QR code scanning for account linking, and simplified notification settings that automatically apply to all relevant medications.

**Accessibility-Focused Component Design:**
```javascript
// Enlarged touch targets for elderly users following accessibility guidelines
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  // Standard button following Apple's 44pt minimum touch target guidelines
  takenButton: {
    flexDirection: 'row', // Arrange icon and text horizontally
    alignItems: 'center', // Center items vertically
    justifyContent: 'center', // Center items horizontally
    backgroundColor: Colors.white, // White background for contrast
    paddingVertical: 14, // Increased from standard 8pt to 14pt for larger touch area
    paddingHorizontal: 20, // Increased horizontal padding for better touch experience
    borderRadius: 16, // Rounded corners for modern appearance
    minHeight: 44, // Ensure minimum 44pt touch target (Apple accessibility standard)
    gap: 8, // Space between icon and text
  },
  
  // High contrast text for improved readability, especially for elderly users
  takenButtonText: {
    color: Colors.primary, // Use primary blue color for brand consistency
    fontSize: 16, // Larger font size than standard for better readability
    fontWeight: 'bold', // Bold weight for improved contrast and visibility
  },
  
  // Clear visual hierarchy for medication list items
  medicationItem: {
    flexDirection: 'row', // Arrange medication info horizontally
    alignItems: 'center', // Center align all content vertically
    paddingVertical: 12, // Increased spacing from standard 8pt to 12pt
    paddingHorizontal: 16, // Adequate horizontal padding for content
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)', // Semi-transparent white background
    borderRadius: 12, // Rounded corners consistent with design system
    marginBottom: 8, // Space between medication items
    minHeight: 48, // Ensure adequate touch area (larger than minimum 44pt)
  }
});
```

**Simplified QR Code Interface:**
```javascript
// Streamlined QR scanning component with clear instructions and error handling
const QRScannerScreen = () => {
  // State for camera permission status
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null);
  // State to track if QR code has been scanned to prevent multiple scans
  const [scanned, setScanned] = useState(false);

  // Request camera permission when component mounts
  useEffect(() => {
    const getBarCodeScannerPermissions = async () => {
      // Request camera access permission from user
      const { status } = await BarCodeScanner.requestPermissionsAsync();
      // Update state with permission status
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
      
      // Show user-friendly explanation if permission denied
      if (status !== 'granted') {
        Alert.alert(
          'Camera Permission Required', // Clear title explaining what's needed
          'Please allow camera access to scan QR codes for connecting with your doctor.', // Detailed explanation
          [{ text: 'OK' }] // Simple acknowledgment button
        );
      }
    };
    getBarCodeScannerPermissions();
  }, []); // Empty dependency array - run only on component mount

  // Handle successful QR code scan
  const handleBarCodeScanned = ({ type, data }) => {
    // Prevent multiple scans by updating state immediately
    setScanned(true);
    
    // Provide clear, immediate feedback to user about successful scan
    Alert.alert(
      'QR Code Scanned Successfully!', // Positive confirmation message
      'Connecting you to your doctor...', // Let user know what happens next
      [{ 
        text: 'OK', 
        onPress: () => connectToDoctor(data) // Proceed with connection when user acknowledges
      }]
    );
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {/* Clear, simple instructions for user */}
      <Text style={styles.instructionText}>
        Point your camera at the QR code provided by your doctor
      </Text>
      
      {/* QR code scanner component */}
      <BarCodeScanner
        // Only listen for scans if not already scanned (prevents duplicates)
        onBarCodeScanned={scanned ? undefined : handleBarCodeScanned}
        style={styles.scanner} // Full-screen scanner area
      />
      
      {/* Allow user to scan another code after successful scan */}
      {scanned && (
        <Button 
          title="Scan Another QR Code" 
          onPress={() => setScanned(false)} // Reset scanned state
        />
      )}
    </View>
  );
};
```

### Clear and Effective User Instructions
The application provides intuitive navigation and clear visual cues throughout the user journey. Error messages are contextual and actionable, guiding users toward successful task completion. The doctor-patient linking process was specifically redesigned based on user feedback to provide clearer instructions and more prominent visual guidance.

**Contextual Help and Instructions:**
```javascript
// Home screen with clear visual hierarchy and contextual guidance
const HomeScreen = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      {/* Header section with personalized greeting and current date context */}
      <View style={styles.header}>
        {/* Personalized greeting based on time of day and user name */}
        <Text style={styles.headerGreeting}>{getGreeting()}</Text>
        {/* Current date in user-friendly format for context */}
        <Text style={styles.headerDate}>
          {selectedDate.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { 
            weekday: 'short', // Mon, Tue, etc.
            month: 'short',   // Jan, Feb, etc.
            day: 'numeric'    // 1, 2, 3, etc.
          })}
        </Text>
      </View>
      
      {/* Contextual medication banner - only appears when medications are due */}
      {medicationBanner && (
        <View style={styles.medicationBanner}>
          {/* Banner header with clear identification of medication time */}
          <View style={styles.bannerHeader}>
            <Text style={styles.bannerTitle}>
              {/* Dynamic title based on time of day */}
              {medicationBanner.timeOfDay === 'morning' ? 'Morning' : 'Evening'} Medications
            </Text>
            {/* Subtitle showing exact number of medications due */}
            <Text style={styles.bannerSubtitle}>
              {medicationBanner.medications.length} medication{medicationBanner.medications.length > 1 ? 's' : ''} to take
            </Text>
          </View>
          
          {/* Clear list of specific medications to take */}
          <View style={styles.medicationList}>
            {medicationBanner.medications.map((med, index) => (
              <View key={index} style={styles.medicationItem}>
                {/* Medication name clearly displayed */}
                <Text style={styles.medicationName}>{med.name}</Text>
                {/* Specific dosage instructions */}
                <Text style={styles.medicationDosage}>
                  {/* Dynamic dosage text based on time of day and amount */}
                  {med[medicationBanner.timeOfDay + 'Dosage'] || '1'} tablet{(med[medicationBanner.timeOfDay + 'Dosage'] || 1) > 1 ? 's' : ''}
                </Text>
              </View>
            ))}
          </View>
          
          {/* Clear call-to-action button with icon and descriptive text */}
          <TouchableOpacity style={styles.takenButton}>
            {/* Checkmark icon provides visual cue for completion action */}
            <Ionicons name="checkmark-circle" size={20} color={Colors.primary} />
            {/* Clear, actionable button text */}
            <Text style={styles.takenButtonText}>I've taken it</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        </View>
      )}
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};
```

**Step-by-Step Onboarding Process:**
```javascript
// Doctor connection wizard with progressive disclosure and clear steps
const DoctorConnectionWizard = () => {
  // Track current step in the wizard (1, 2, or 3)
  const [step, setStep] = useState(1);
  
  // Render appropriate step content based on current step
  const renderStep = () => {
    switch(step) {
      case 1:

};
```

### Use of Colour Screen
The color scheme was strategically designed to enhance usability and accessibility. The mobile app uses light colors with high contrast ratios to support elderly users, while the web dashboard employs a professional dark theme suitable for clinical environments. The consistent use of vibrant blue as the primary color maintains brand coherence across all platforms while providing excellent visual hierarchy and user guidance.

---

## Design of Color Scheme and Logo

I decided to use a **dark color scheme** for the website and a **light scheme** for the mobile app to make it more accessible for elderly users. I chose a **vibrant blue** as the primary color for both apps to maintain design consistency. 

For the logo, I used a **cross symbol**, which represents a hospital, and put a **leaf** over it to give it a natural aesthetic and design interest whilst still keeping it simple. I used ChatGPT to generate the image and made its color the primary color.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d462f3d-ca46-47bf-ad7e-d390c9452da3)

### Design of Color Scheme – Web Dashboard

For the website, I chose:
- **Off-white** for the primary text color
- **Light grey** for the secondary text color
- **Dark black** for the primary background color
- **Slightly lighter shade of black** for the secondary background color (raised elements)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fae2414-36b7-4df6-bd21-5cfb7e2ccec3)

### Design of Color Scheme – Mobile App

I kept the same primary color for the mobile app but went with a **light mode** to increase accessibility for older users. The background colors are varying shades of white and two different shades for text which are slightly blue-black, providing good contrast with the background colors whilst also keeping with the primary blue color.

## Problems Encountered and How They Were Overcome

### 1. AWS RDS Database Connection Issues
I used an **AWS relational database using PostgreSQL** to store the data for my project, which is useful as it can be connected from anywhere in the world. However, connecting to it was initially very difficult to figure out as there is lots of security to prevent bad actors from accessing your data. 

**Solution:** I was eventually able to filter it so that only requests from my PC could access it, and then made my backend Express server the interface between the doctor and patient platforms as well as the RDS.

### 2. Firebase Login on Mobile App
I was easily able to get Firebase working on the doctor dashboard, however, when setting it up on the mobile app, my app would fail to compile. Upon research, I found many others having this issue, and it was because, a few days prior, **Expo had a major update** which stopped Firebase from working.

**Solution:** I had to change the `metro.config.js` file to import the ESM version of Firebase, as the previous version would cause conflicting Firebase versions to be imported.

### 3. Prisma Database Structure Issues
When I was trying to create an API endpoint for my backend to add medications to the user, I had set up my database using **Prisma (ORM)** in a weird way so that pills were a custom item, and this would mean that when I fetched all of the users, it wouldn't show me their medications.

**Solution:** I removed the custom pill item and made their list of pills JSON. This means I can now add or remove single medications at a time or reset their entire list.

---

## Testing of the Product on the Intended Audience

My project has a broad intended audience as it works well to remind people of all ages to take their medication. I therefore tested it on:
- **One kid (age 16)**
- **One adult (age 43)**
- **One elderly person (age 66)**

These tests provided valuable feedback from a real user perspective which allowed me to incorporate some useful changes. I got each person to use the app for a day and report on any bugs, the quality of the app, and if it helped them remember to take their medications.

### Testing on the 16-Year-Old

**Feedback:**
- Found the initial setup process to be straightforward
- Suggested that the home screen could be more visually engaging
- Noted that the notification reminders were helpful
- Wanted to see reminders in the app to show specifically what medication they needed to take at that time

**Improvements Made:**
- The home screen was redesigned to include a more dynamic calendar and a "Today's Schedule" view
- Added a section at the top of the home screen that would only appear when you had a reminder to take, so after clicking on the notification it would show in the app what you had to take

### Testing on the 43-Year-Old

**Feedback:**
- Appreciated the simplicity of the app
- Found it difficult to manually add new medications
- Didn't want their doctors to have to manually create medications each time
- Expressed a desire for more detailed information about each medication

**Improvements Made:**
- A "Medication Library" feature was added to the web dashboard, allowing doctors to add and manage a list of pre-approved medications
- The mobile app was updated to include a "Medication Detail" screen, providing more information about each pill
- The process of adding a medication on the mobile app was streamlined to make it easier and simpler

### Testing on the 66-Year-Old

**Feedback:**
- Had some difficulty navigating the app, particularly when linking their account with their doctor
- Found the process of setting medication reminders to be confusing
- Found a few of the components hard to click on

**Improvements Made:**
- The QR code scanning feature was made more prominent to simplify the doctor-patient linking process
- The notification settings were streamlined, allowing users to set a single time for morning and evening reminders, which are then automatically applied to all relevant medications
- Sized up the interactable components to improve accessibility

### Evaluating Feedback

This user feedback was valuable in identifying age-specific usability challenges and helped guide meaningful improvements:

- **Younger user** focused on visual engagement and interactivity, leading to enhancements in the home screen layout and notification functionality
- **Middle-aged user** highlighted practical limitations in data entry and information access, prompting the addition of a Medication Library and detailed medication views
- **Older user** faced navigational challenges, resulting in streamlined processes for account linking and reminder setup

Overall, the feedback reflected diverse user needs and directly informed targeted refinements that improved both usability and user experience across age groups.

## Other Forms of Testing Used

- **Unit tests** to verify the functionality of individual components (using Jest)
- **Integration testing** (manually testing the connection between the mobile app and doctor dashboard with the backend)
- **API testing** using Bruno to ensure all endpoints functioned properly and gave the correct output
- **Cross-browser testing** using BrowserStack to test the web dashboard across different browsers
- **Peer review** from coding-experienced friends

### Unit Testing

An example of where unit testing using Jest (a unit testing library for JavaScript) was used in my program was for testing the doctor's list of patients on the web dashboard. It encountered that it wouldn't properly render if it couldn't connect to the backend, and would just crash the website.

**Solution:** Added error handling that would display "Unable to fetch patient data."
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27d1f6c7-bd4f-492b-bc24-d19d51b146a6)

### Integration Testing

This testing focused on the interactions between different parts of the system. During a manual test, it was discovered that when a doctor deleted a medication from the web dashboard, the mobile app would crash if the user opened it before the data had fully synced.

**Solution:** Added error handling in the app to gracefully manage cases where a medication is not found, preventing the crash and ensuring a smoother user experience.

### API Testing

The API testing with Bruno was very helpful for developing the API, as I could code an endpoint which connects to the Prisma database, then quickly and easily request that endpoint on Bruno to see if it produced the desired output.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/063304f0-445d-4085-9958-6f79e29d016a)

### Cross-Browser Testing

Using BrowserStack, the web dashboard was tested across various browsers. It was discovered that on older versions of Microsoft Edge, the search bar in the medication library was too wide, making it look poorly made. This was due to an outdated CSS Flexbox property.

**Solution:** The CSS was updated with a more widely supported syntax, fixing the layout issue and ensuring the dashboard is usable for doctors on different browsers.

### Peer Review

I got two of my friends, **George** and **Ralph**, who both know how to code, to read over sections of my app to identify any possible errors:

- **George** acted as a **black-box tester**, focusing purely on the user experience and external functionality without looking at the underlying code. He interacted with the app as an end user would, checking for bugs, broken features, or usability issues.

- **Ralph** performed **white-box testing**. He read through sections of the codebase directly, examining the internal logic, flow, and structure to identify any potential bugs or inefficiencies.

By combining both of their testing approaches, their feedback gave me a lot of helpful improvements.

### Conclusion from Testing

The combination of user testing and other testing methodologies has been instrumental in shaping the ReMedi application. The feedback from users of different ages and technical abilities has led to significant improvements in the app's usability and functionality. The result is a more intuitive, user-friendly, and reliable application that effectively helps patients manage their medications and stay connected with their healthcare providers. Overall, this testing provides a demonstration of quality assurance in my code.

## Version Control Used to Track Changes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cbf6403-92bb-41b0-83d3-2a165c728473)

- I extensively used **version control** throughout my project, and it was extremely useful
- I used **Git in VS Code** as it provided an easy GUI to manage the version control
- It was very useful as whenever I made a change that worked properly, I would commit that change to version control
- This means that when I was trying to create a new feature and broke it, I could just go back to the last point where it was working
- This helped me many times throughout the project where I made big changes but couldn't get them to work, so I just reset to the last commit
- Without version control it would have taken ages to find and undo every single change that I made

### List of the Commits:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9690c0d4-e6a1-444d-a328-32ac84592b59)

---

## Actual Timeline vs Projected Timeline

I was able to compare the actual timeline to the initial timeline by looking at the version control to see what changes I made and when.

### Key Differences:
- **Went 2 days over** the time expected to finish
- **Started all parts** (backend, mobile app, and doctor dashboard) roughly around the same time, as I wanted to test them working together
- **Backend took longer** than expected due to adding more features than initially planned
- **Started the doctor dashboard earlier** and added much more features than initially planned
- **Patient app was worked on for a longer period** than expected, however there were weeks where it was not worked on, so ended up taking roughly the same amount of time to make as expected, just over a longer timeframe

## Sample Sections of Code

### Backend (server.js)

The sample section of code below is the start of the backend code (`server.js`):
- It sets up the backend server and allows CORS (as this was blocking requests from the website and mobile app)
- It then sets up the middleware to parse JSON request bodies
- Three API endpoints are then defined, each with purposes as illustrated by the comments
- Robust error handling is used so that the web dashboard or mobile app can gracefully show an error message without crashing, and uses a generic error response to prevent sensitive information being sent as an error message

```javascript
// Import required dependencies
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Initialize Express app and router
const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

// Initialize Prisma client for database operations
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

// Configure CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests
app.use(cors({
    origin: true, // Dynamically allow all origins
    credentials: true, // Enable credentials for cross-origin requests
}));

// Middleware to parse JSON request bodies
app.use(express.json());

// Use the router for all routes
app.use(router);

// GET /doctors - Retrieve all doctors from the database
router.get('/doctors', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Fetch all doctor records from the database
        const doctors = await prisma.doctor.findMany();
        res.json(doctors);
    } catch (error) {
        // Log the error for debugging purposes
        console.error(error);
        // Return a generic error message to the client
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred' });
    }
});

// GET /doctorsPatients/:id - Get all patients assigned to a specific doctor
router.get('/doctorsPatients/:id', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // First, find the doctor by ID to ensure they exist
        const doctor = await prisma.doctor.findUnique({
            where: { id: req.params.id }
        });
        
        // Find all patients that belong to this doctor
        const doctorsPatients = await prisma.patient.findMany({
            where: { doctorId: doctor.id }
        });
        
        res.json(doctorsPatients);
    } catch (error) {
        // Log the error details for server-side debugging
        console.error(error);
        // Send a generic error response to avoid exposing sensitive information
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred' });
    }
});

// GET /doctors/:id - Retrieve a specific doctor by their ID
router.get('/doctors/:id', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Find a single doctor by their unique ID
        const doctor = await prisma.doctor.findUnique({
            where: { id: req.params.id }
        });
        
        // Return 404 if doctor doesn't exist
        if (!doctor) {
            return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Doctor not found' });
        }
        
        res.json(doctor);
    } catch (error) {
        // Log the error for debugging and monitoring
        console.error(error);
        // Return a server error response with generic message
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred' });
    }
});
```

### Doctor Dashboard

The following code is for the sign-in function on the doctor dashboard login page:
- This code calls a Firebase sign-in function and handles each possible error with a clear, user-friendly toast message ("Incorrect password!", "User not found!", etc.)
- By identifying error codes, it avoids spamming technical logs to the user interface
- A catch-all error path ensures any unexpected errors are also caught, preventing app crashes
- The `console.log` statements assist developers with debugging, while the `toast.error` calls inform users something went wrong without exposing sensitive details

```javascript
/**
 * SignIn function - Handles user authentication
 * @param {Object} creds - User credentials (email, password)
 * @param {Function} onSuccess - Callback function to execute on successful sign in
 */
const SignIn = useCallback(
	async (creds, onSuccess) => {
			// Set loading state to true to show loading indicators
			setIsLoading(true);

			// Attempt to sign in using Firebase authentication service
			TAuth.firebaseSignIn(creds)
				.then(userCredential => {
					// Extract user from the credential response
					const {
						user
					} = userCredential;

					// Check if user exists in the response
					if (user) {
						// Set the current user in state
						setCurrentUser(user);

### Mobile App

The sample section of code for the mobile app shows the process of linking a patient to a doctor with QR code scanning:
- Before performing the link, it checks that `doctorCode` isn't empty to guide the user properly
- The `try/catch` block ensures that if any network or server issue arises, the user sees a popup alert with an appropriate message, while deeper details go to `console.error` for developers
- The `connectResponse.ok` check allows for a fallback alert containing a user-friendly hint if the server returns a non-200 status
- Overall, providing a graceful error path prevents app crashes or confusing blank screens

```javascript
/**
 * Handles linking a patient to a doctor using a doctor code
 * This function validates input, makes API calls to establish the connection,
 * and provides user feedback throughout the process
 */
const linkToDoctor = async () => {
	// Validate that a doctor code has been entered
	if (!doctorCode.trim()) {
		Alert.alert("Error", "Please enter a doctor code");
		return;
	}

	// Set loading state to disable the button and show progress
	setLinking(true);

	try {
		// Get the current user's email from Firebase authentication
		const userEmail = auth.currentUser?.email;

		// First API call: Get the patient ID from their email address
		const idResponse = await fetch(`http://${ip}:3000/idFromEmail/${userEmail}`);
		const idData = await idResponse.json();

		// Verify the user is a patient (not a doctor)
		if (idData.type === 'patient') {
			// Second API call: Connect the patient to the doctor using the provided code
			const connectResponse = await fetch(`http://${ip}:3000/connect`, {
				method: 'PATCH',
				headers: {
					'Content-Type': 'application/json',
				},
				body: JSON.stringify({
					patientId: idData.id, // Patient's database ID
					doctorId: doctorCode.trim() // Doctor's code/ID entered by user
				}),
			});

			// Check if the connection was successful
			if (connectResponse.ok) {
				// Success: Show confirmation and clean up UI
				Alert.alert("Success", "Successfully linked to your doctor!");
				setShowDoctorLinkModal(false); // Close the modal
				setDoctorCode(''); // Clear the input field
				fetchDoctorInfo(); // Refresh doctor info to show the new connection
			} else {
				// Failure: Parse error message from server and display to user
				const errorData = await connectResponse.json();
				Alert.alert("Error", errorData.error || "Failed to link to doctor. Please check the code and try again.");
			}
		}
	} catch (error) {
		// Handle network errors or other exceptions
		console.error('Error linking to doctor:', error);
		Alert.alert("Error", "Failed to link to doctor. Please try again.");
	} finally {
		// Always reset loading state, regardless of success or failure
		setLinking(false);
	}
};
```
